21. Product Use. Licensees use our software as a ‘dev tool’ to harden their developed software applications.  Preemptive Software tools are used as a security layer to mitigate risks of third-party software reverse engineering and attacks.

25. Billing and Renewal. PreEmptive charges in advance for Subscription agreements. An authorized License Administrator may request additional licensing by completing an additional written Order Form. The fee for the added licensing will be the then current, generally applicable fee. PreEmptive reserves the right to modify its fees and to introduce new fees at any time upon at least thirty days prior notice to Licensee, which notice may be provided by e-mail. Standard fees do not include processing through an electronic invoicing system, Licensee shall pay a separate fee for use of such a system. All pricing terms are confidential; Licensee agrees not to disclose them.
